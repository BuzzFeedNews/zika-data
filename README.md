## Global Data

#### Zika Virus

- The Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization is publishing [weekly counts of suspected and confirmed cases, by country and territory](http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/ed_zika_epicurve.asp), as reported by each country. The data portal includes a few important notes:
    - "The suspected cases in Brazil are unofficial (media monitoring)"
    - "Data is shared in an effort to transparently disseminate available information reported by Member States. Any subsequent interpretation and analysis of this data should consider differences in surveillance systems and reporting requirements."

- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is tracking [countries and territories with local Zika transmission](http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/zika_virus_infection/zika-outbreak/Pages/Zika-countries-with-transmission.aspx) and classifying them into several categories.

- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is maintaining a list of "[Countries and territories with active Zika virus transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/active-countries.html)." The Pan American Health Organization is maintaining a [similiar list](http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11603&Itemid=41696).

- HealthMap.org is [mapping news and social-media alerts](http://www.healthmap.org/zika/) about Zika.

- Wikipedia's [page on the outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus_outbreak_in_the_Americas_\(2015%E2%80%93present\)) includes a referenced table of confirmed case counts since April 2015, by country.

#### Mosquitoes

[Per the WHO](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/zika/en/), "Zika virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever."

- [The global compendium of *Aedes aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* occurrence](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201535). [Data, as CSV files, available here](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.47v3c). Published 2015-07-07 in *Nature Scientific Data*.
    - "A global geographic database of known occurrences of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* between 1960 and 2014 [...] derived from peer-reviewed literature and unpublished studies including national entomological surveys and expert networks. [...] This is the first comprehensive global database of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* occurrence, consisting of 19,930 and 22,137 geo-positioned occurrence records respectively."
