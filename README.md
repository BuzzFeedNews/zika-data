## Global Data

#### Zika Virus

- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is maintaining a list of "[Countries and territories with active Zika virus transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html)."

- The Pan American Health Organization is maintaining a [similiar list](http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11603&Itemid=41696).

#### Mosquitoes

[Per the WHO](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/zika/en/), "Zika virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever."

- [The global compendium of *Aedes aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* occurrence](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201535). Published 2015-07-07 in *Nature Scientific Data*.
    - "A global geographic database of known occurrences of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* between 1960 and 2014 [...] derived from peer-reviewed literature and unpublished studies including national entomological surveys and expert networks. [...] This is the first comprehensive global database of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* occurrence, consisting of 19,930 and 22,137 geo-positioned occurrence records respectively."

#### United States

Not many U.S. states are currently publishing structured data on Zika. But some do maintain Zika information pages, which might contain relevant data in the future. A partial list:

- California
    - [Information page](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Zika.aspx)
    - ["Travel-Associated Cases of Zika Virus in California"](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Documents/TravelAssociatedCasesofZikaVirusinCA.pdf), updated every Friday.

- Florida
    - [Information page](http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/zika-virus/index.html?utm_source=flhealthIndex)

- Virginia
    - [Information page](http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/Zika/index.htm)

- Texas
    - [Information page](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu/disease/arboviral/zika/)
    - [News updates](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news/updates.shtm)

In the meantime, Scientific American is collecting unstructured data (e.g., news releases) from state health departments, and [mapping the known U.S. cases](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zika-virus-threatens-u-s-from-abroad1/).
