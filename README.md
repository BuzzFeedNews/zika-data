## Global Data

#### Zika Virus

- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is maintaining a list of "[Countries and territories with active Zika virus transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html)."

- The Pan American Health Organization is maintaining a [similiar list](http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11603&Itemid=41696).

- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is tracking [countries and territories with local Zika transmission](http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/zika_virus_infection/zika-outbreak/Pages/Zika-countries-with-transmission.aspx) and classifying them into several categories.

- The World Health Organization is not yet publishing structured data, but publishes a [page of Zika outbreak news](http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/zika-virus-infection/en/).

- HealthMap.org is [mapping news and social-media alerts](http://www.healthmap.org/zika/) about Zika.

- Wikipedia's [page on the outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus_outbreak_in_the_Americas_\(2015%E2%80%93present\)) includes a referenced table of confirmed case counts since April 2015, by country.

#### Mosquitoes

[Per the WHO](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/zika/en/), "Zika virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever."

- [The global compendium of *Aedes aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* occurrence](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201535). [Data, as CSV files, available here](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.47v3c). Published 2015-07-07 in *Nature Scientific Data*.
    - "A global geographic database of known occurrences of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* between 1960 and 2014 [...] derived from peer-reviewed literature and unpublished studies including national entomological surveys and expert networks. [...] This is the first comprehensive global database of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* occurrence, consisting of 19,930 and 22,137 geo-positioned occurrence records respectively."


## Country-Specific Data

#### Brazil

- Brazil's health ministry is publishing [reports on Zika and microcephaly](http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/o-ministerio/principal/leia-mais-o-ministerio/197-secretaria-svs/20799-microcefalia). The [latest covers through 2016-01-30](http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/images/pdf/2016/fevereiro/02/COES-Microcefalias---Informe-Epidemiol--gico-11---SE-04-2016---02jan2016---18h51-VDP.pdf).

#### Colombia

- Colombia's national institute of health is publishing [Zika-related reports](http://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/ZIKA/Forms/AllItems.aspx), including regional counts of suspected Zika samples sent to the agency for testing. The [latest covers 2015-09-01 through 2016-01-29](http://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/ZIKA/reporte%20zika-02.pdf).


#### United States

Not many U.S. states are currently publishing structured data on Zika. But some do maintain Zika information pages, which might contain relevant data in the future. A partial list:

- California
    - [Information page](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Zika.aspx)
    - ["Travel-Associated Cases of Zika Virus in California"](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Documents/TravelAssociatedCasesofZikaVirusinCA.pdf), updated every Friday.

- Florida
    - [Information page](http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/zika-virus/index.html?utm_source=flhealthIndex)

- Virginia
    - [Information page](http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/Zika/index.htm)

- Texas
    - [Information page](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu/disease/arboviral/zika/)
    - [News updates](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news/updates.shtm)

In the meantime, Scientific American is collecting unstructured data (e.g., news releases) from state health departments, and [mapping the known U.S. cases](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zika-virus-threatens-u-s-from-abroad1/).
